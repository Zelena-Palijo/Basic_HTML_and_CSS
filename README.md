# Basic HTML and CSS

This repository should be included with the "Basic HTML Course" repository. 
It includes the various projects I worked on throughout the Basic HTML and CSS course. 
Most of the projects involve applying a basic HTML template, with smaller CSS challenges to learn the cause/effect of certain CSS styles.
